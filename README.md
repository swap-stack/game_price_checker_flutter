# Game Price Checker Flutter App

App to check price of games. Fetches data from an API endpoint created by me using FastAPI [HERE](https://github.com/swap-stack/game_scrape_fastapi) deployed on Heroku.

This is a fun project to challenge and display my skills in different Frameworks (Backend: FastAPI & Frontend: Flutter) as well as a means to learn and apply web crawling.
